Mad villain Mr. B who even hates unicorns and rainbows wants to annihilate all the dumplings (yes in English meaning which consists every each kind of a little dumpling).
I know, only thinking about it probably makes you want to scream, but get a hold of yourself.
 
Because there is a hope to keep it in our precious world, since Mr. B in his insanity gives you a chance to save the world by playing with his little riddle game.
He asks you for a sequence of 8 numbers from range 0-100  and then gives you the guideline with next steps how to process them
1). Now sort it and make it original, there is no place for duplicates.
2). Everything that cannot be divided by 5 will be on the back.
3). 2 last numbers which can be divided by 5 can will exchange the place of 2 numbers in backwards order that cannot be divided by 5 next to them.
4). All numbers before the first number bigger than the one on the front, shall be put on the back.
 
If the sequence is correct you may keep your bloody dumplings but you may hear about me againâ€¦
